        <li>Set your stove to medium heat and let your pan warm up</li>
        <li>Once warm, place the tortilla in the pan for 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Flip the tortilla and add all your cheese on one half of the fortilla</li>
        <li>Fold the side without cheese over onto the side with cheese and press it down for at least 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Flip the quesadilla onto the other side and press down for another 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Take the quesadilla off the pan, turn off the stove, and enjoy!</li>
